# About

This is my software development blog, using the [DevBlog](https://github.com/RyanFitzgerald/devblog) template. Here I write about my jouney to becoming a software engineer.

For more information about me, Jade Rickerts, check out [my portfolio website](https://jaderickerts.com).

In this blog I write about the applications I developed. Through writing I hope to improve my own development skills and also keep a record that I look back to see how much I've grown as a software developer and a blogger.
