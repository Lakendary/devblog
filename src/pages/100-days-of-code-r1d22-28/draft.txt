This past week was a gruelling week for me. I didn't write any code at home or learn anything new from the ASP.NET
Core course. All I did was work on new features for JRS Document Storage and fix bugs.

At work I am under immense pressure to release the new version of JRS Document Storage and other duties at work that
needs my urgent attention. Therefore, when I got home, I wasn't in the mood for anything else. I didn't tweet about
my progress. I didn't update my log on Github. I spent time with my family when I got a chance. 

I did learn something this week that I can take with me as a developer. Some of these points are conventional and 
not just applicable to software development.

Protecting my time was futile

I am currently employed as a Business Analyst. However, during my tenure, I've given a lot of technical support to 
our staff. Now that we've gotten to a stage where I have more analysis and development work to do. This part of my 
job my colleagues don't notice. They come to me with their technical queries, no matter how much I try to explain 
that I do not have the time to assist.

Protecting my time is a constant battle. Co-workers would send me an email, call me on my land line, then my work cell 
phone and finally my personal cell phone in that order to get a hold of me. Those who are in the office, walk into my 
office and expect assistance. Others who aren't in the office, sends another office colleague to come to me personally
to request that I urgently attend to their call.

I know there are lots of strategies out there to protect your time. I could have probably read up on a few of them. 
But when you have co-workers that only want their problems solved and they don't care about your time or schedule, 
I doubt anything on the Internet was going to get me out of this jam.

The only thing that I can work at this point, besides ignoring everyone, is working remotely. This is something I am 
working towards and hopefully I can convince my boss this is the right move. Or with time, my colleagues will learn
to respect my time and let me get on with my job.

Getting comfortable with imperfections

As time runs out and deadlines are fast approaching, the need to perfect your code goes out the window. Things get 
even more stressful closer to the deadline. What can go wrong, will go wrong. You will get error messages that you
have no idea how to fix or the solution isn't that simple to implement. You have to let things go and hope you can 
implement it in the next version.
