Introduction
Another week down, another blog post. I didn't skip out on any coding this week, however, I did do some coding at work one day instead of at home.
This upcoming week I'll be doing some maintenance on the JRS Document Storage desktop application (insert link here). I probably won't learn a lot of new stuff.
I will continue with the 5AM tutorials though.

Main learning points this week:
1. It gets easier over time
2. Bootstrap / UI 
3. Form submission (creation, validation and file upload)
4. Database creation with migration / EF Core
5. XML file to Combo Box
