After some careful consideration, I've decided to change my main focus from desktop development to web development. It's a decision I haven't take lightly. So why am I leaving desktop development behind?

<!-- end -->

Why did I get into deskop development?

- Main development area at school
- Development opportunites at work
- Ease of development

Why web development

- Websites aren't going anywhere soon
- Develop on any platform, for all devices
- A lot more job opportunities
- Lower barrier to enty
- Opportunity for freelancing or business

Until next time. Thanks for reading.
